- 👋 Hi, I’m @faguilar0291 or Fernando Aguilar as I am formally known.
- 👀 I have always been interested in technology and how it works.
- 🌱 I am currently learning by doing with some projects to show 
      how much I have learned about Web Development and show how well 
      I do things when I set my mind to it.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on a big project like Fullstack, Front End or Back End. 
      I like design, so maybe I lean more towards the Front and think about how a web application 
      or website can work for clients, in a way that is easy to use and intuitive.
